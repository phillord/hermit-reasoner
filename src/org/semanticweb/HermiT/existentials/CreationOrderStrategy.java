 * Strategy for expanding all existentials on the oldest node in the tableau with unexpanded existentials.
 * This usually closely approximates a breadth-first expansion. (Existentials introduced onto parent nodes
 * as a result of constraints on their children can produce newer nodes of lower depth than older nodes,
 * which could result in slight non-breadth-first behavior.)
